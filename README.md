# Caronte Mandate 2

Caronte mandate is a first-person VR game where you will play a father who is tortured by his daughter because of the choices he made in life.
The map is distributed in several zones, the room at the beginning, where everything will start, and the three puzzle rooms.
This is a project for the university career and the team behind this game is TDM, a group formed by CITM students.

## Controls:

- With the right Joystick you will be able to move around the map.
- With the right Joystick you can rotate the camera little by little or 180 degrees.
- With the grips buttons you can grab objects on the map.
